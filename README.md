This project will be to build a simple functioning website.

This is my first HTML project where I am prompted by The Odin Project to build a basic recipe website. The problem is, I do not know much about cooking nor do I want to just copy and paste ingredients and instructions off the web. Therefore, I will make a change to the project prompt and instead, create a basic website on how to complete quests from the popular online game "Old School RuneScape".

The reason I chose to base my project on a game is because I see a parallel between completing quests and cooking up a dish from a recipe. Both have skill requirements, ingredients to acquire and prepare, and appropriate steps to take in order to achieve the final goal of completion.

It is important to keep in mind that, although it will not be visually appealing, this project is just meant to build up my fundamental HTML skills on how to structure a website. By its completion, I will have demonstrated proper usage of HTML tags and elements, referencing relative paths, and attaching links and images in order to produce a simple functioning website.
