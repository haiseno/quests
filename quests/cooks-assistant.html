        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Lumbridge Castle Cook is in a terrible mess. Today is the Duke of Lumbridge's birthday and the Cook is in charge of baking him a lovely big birthday cake. However, the Cook needs a lot of ingredients but he has forgotten to buy <em>any</em> of them. He'll never get them in time now. Worse, he'll be beheaded! What is he going to do? He has a wife, four children, and a goat to look after. Will you, the adventurer, help him in his predicament?</p>

        <h2>Required Items</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bucket</li></lo>
            <li>Pot</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Bucket of milk</li>
            <li>Pot of flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Starting out</h3>
        <p>Begin the quest by speaking to the Cook in the Lumbridge Castle kitchen. A bucket is available in the cellar of Lumbridge Castle, and a pot in the kitchen where you begin; be sure to grab these as they are nearby and you will need them later. Both can also be purchased from the Lumbridge General Store for 2 coins and 1 coin, respectively.</p>

        <h3>Egg</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Go east out of Lumbridge Castle.</li>
            <li>Run north along the path until you reach the chicken coop north-west of Farmer Fred's house.</li>
            <li>Go into the chicken coop and pick up an egg from the ground.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Bucket of milk</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>From the chicken coop, with an empty bucket, go north into the cow pasture.</li>
            <li>Use the empty bucket on the dairy cow to obtain a bucket of milk.
                <ul>
                    <li>Optional: You may talk to Gillie Groats in the Lumbridge cow field across the river to the east for an explanation on how to get milk from a cow. There is also another dairy cow right next to her there.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Pot of flour</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Leave the cow pasture, with an empty pot, and go south-west to the wheat field.</li>
            <li>Pick up a bundle of grain.</li>
            <li>Leave the wheat field and enter the nearby Mill Lane Mill to the north-east.
                <ul>
                    <li>Optional: You may talk to Millie Miller inside the mill for an explanation on how to make flour.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Climb up the ladder to the top floor.</li>
            <li>Put the grain in the hopper.</li>
            <li>Pull the lever.</li>
            <li>Climb back down the ladder to the 1st floor.</li>
            <li>Using your empty pot, collect the flour from the flour bin to obtain a pot of flour.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Delivery</h3>
        <p>After collecting all three ingredients, return to Lumbridge Castle by following the path south-east of the mill and speak to the Cook in the kitchen to deliver them.</p>
